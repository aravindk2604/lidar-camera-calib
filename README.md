# A project to demonstrate the following  

* Camera Calibration  
* Camera -- LiDAR cross calibration (W.I.P)    
* Visualization of RGB data in point cloud (W.I.P)    

---
This project was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic
Clone the repo, download the rosbag from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16PdqoSVnvelMBUb1EpImWJoqm6Q9HX4N) and follow the instructions below to run it.

> You have to edit the location of the rosbag; pointing to wherever it is on your system, in the `lidar_composite.launch` file inside the `lidar-calib` package

# Run - Task 2 Camera-LiDAR calibration

```
cd lidar-camera-calib/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch lidar_calib lidar_composite.launch

```

You should see an image window pop-up showing the video of the LiDAR points projected on the image frame. 

You can also visualize the LiDAR and the composite lidar image data on rviz.  

# Run - Task 3 RGB Point Cloud Data Visualization

[![RGB Point Cloud Visualization on RVIZ](_results/task3_vid.png)](https://youtu.be/fTRS81-PgBw)


```
cd lidar-camera-calib/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch lidar_calib rgb_lidar.launch

```

This can be visualized on rviz by running

```
rosrun rviz rviz
```

> Make sure to add the PointCloud2 topic `rgb_output` and set the size of the Flat Squares to atleast `0.08` to properly get the output.

> The transformation is still not accurate and thus the output is average, which can be improved.
